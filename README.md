# JetbotPy is a file for Jetbot class 
* movement stuff is added and can be modified 
* Since the movement of the real jetbot is not accurate, we also used inaccurate motions for calculation
# Run the Tesing.py file. 
* The position of the jetbot can be calculated 
* The trajectory of the jetbot including position and heading can be printed and plotted
